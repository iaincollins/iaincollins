# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

I'm an engineering leader with 25 years of commercial experience across the full product life cycle in startups, SMEs and enterprise organizations, delivering best-in-class, cross platform solutions for the web, desktop, server, mobile and network devices with contributions to open source spanning over 20 years.

I've worked in startups and founded companies but have spent most of my career in internet and media companies, designing and building everything from websites and services to infrastructure (core networks, device firmware, custom kernels and extensions and physical infrastructure; servers, switching and storage) to desktop applications for macOS, Windows and Linux and for mobile devices, working with dozens of programming languages, platforms, operating systems and a wide range of hardware.

I enjoy supporting and growing engineers and working collaboratively in cross functional teams to design, build and support products and services. I'm able to zoom in to provide practical, hands-on support with software development and system design, which allows me to leverage practical experience to anticipate potential pitfalls, empathically relate to teams and to articulate commercial pressures and technical problems in ways that resonate with teams and stakeholders. I have the broader commercial experience to be able to step back and provide support and strategic advice for engineering and product teams and help them optimise for delivery and value.

# üíº Recent Work

My recent work has been leading multiple teams and projects for news and media organizations and with government projects and NGOs, including for BBC News Labs, The Economist and Reach/TrinityMirror (the UK's largest commercial news publisher) on web products and services, engineering culture, ways of working and overseeing replatforming, analytics and machine learning projects.

I still enjoy designing and building things, but I'm usually contributing more leading and support engineering teams, product owners, delivery managers and stakeholders/customers in delivering great products and services.

# üõ† Side Projects

## üîë  [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

_Leading authentication solution designed for modern web stacks, including Next.js and Serverless._

As an open source, community supported project based around interoperability with open standards, NextAuth.js has grown to support dozens of auth providers and a wide range of SQL and no-SQL databases.

Originally developed for React, it has also been ported to other popular frameworks, including Vue.js and Svelte - and can be used with non-JavaScript frameworks, such as Drupal.

To ensure it remains open source, collaborative and independent it has been spun off into a dedicated organization, supported by a team of talented and hard working contributors.

## üé¨  Mercury

_Video management, transcription and translation tool. Sponsored by the Google DNI Prototype fund._

Designed for news and media organisations, Mercury allows teams to to upload, edit, transcode, transcribe and translate audio and video files (in a wide range of formats, including large, unprocessed files) from anywhere in the world on any web enabled device (including a smartphone) and share them in a secure and searchable way with colleagues.

On the technical side, it uses an open source technology stack; including ESCMAScript, React and Web Sockets and uses both Serverless and Container based services. It is horizontally scaling and can be run on Amazon Web Services (AWS S3), Goggle Cloud Platform (Google Drive / Cloud Storage) and on self-hosted servers (local storage, NAS).

It supports integration with multiple specialist transcription, translation and synthetic voice services from IBM, Google and Microsoft and other specalist vendors.

## üß∞  [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://github.com/glitchdigital/structured-data-testing-tool)

_Library and command line tool to help inspect and test Structured Data._

Designed to fill a gap in tooling in Google Lighthouse and Google's own Stuctured Data Testing Tool, by providing an extendible command line tool and API that includes out of the box support for checking both Schema.org entities and social media markup.

This tool is useful for any website but especially useful for news and media organizations as ensuring markup quality can have a significant impact on taffic coming from Google News and Google Discover as well as organic traffic.

## üß∞  [Table to JSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabletojson)

_Library and command line tool to extract data from webpages._

A library useful for data scraping, origionally created to support work on civic tech and data journalism. [It's used by dozens of other packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/tabletojson), including other higher level scraper libraries. Table To JSON is now maintained by @maugenst. 

## üëæ ICARUS for Elite Dangerous

ICARUS  is a cross platform companion app for the game Elite Dangerous, the modern online, multiplayer universe sucessor to the 1984 classic space game Elite. The name ICARUS was suggested by a player and chosen by the community.

The app hooks into Elite Dangerous to provide context-sensitive real time information (event driven and socket based) by combining the public Elite Dangerous game API with third party APIs and agumenting them with additional contextual data to inform, entertain and support players.

I initially developed a proof of concept for the idea in Electron, but have since refactored it into a single binary that comes in at under 20MB; using JavaScript, Go and native OS APIs to create a lightweight but highly portable cross platform application that runs on Windows, Mac, Linux as well as Andriod and iOS devices. 

This is a new project and I haven't released a binary or the source publically yet, but have released a few screenshots and a couple of videos.
