# About me

_I'm an engineering lead with 20-30 years experience developing cross platform software for the web, desktop, server, mobile and networks (including core networks) with contributions to open source spanning over two decades. I've worked in startups, large enterprises, non-profit/civic-tech projects around the world and started two companies (and far too many side projects)._

# ‚úç Recent Side Projects

Most of my public work on GitHub is on personal side projects and these span a lot of languages, platforms and types of software. I've highlighted a few of them below. [I also sometimes write about stuff on Medium](https://iaincollins.medium.com/).

ICARUS Terminal is a companion app / second screen for the game Elite Dangerous, the modern online, multiplayer universe successor to the 1984 classic space game Elite. Designed for both desktop/laptop computers and for tablets/phones.

The app hooks into the game to provide context-sensitive real time information (event driven and socket based) by combining the game API with third party APIs and agumenting them with additional contextual data to inform, entertain and help players.

It is built with React, Node.js, Go, C++ and native OS APIs and uses GitHub releases API to drive updating. It is distrubted as a full self-contained installer that comes in at around 20MB.

As an open source, community supported project based around interoperability with open standards, NextAuth.js has grown to support dozens of auth providers and a wide range of SQL and no-SQL databases.

Originally developed for React, it has also been ported to other popular frameworks, including Vue.js and Svelte - and can be used with non-JavaScript frameworks, such as Drupal.

To ensure it remains open source, collaborative and independent it has been spun off into a dedicated organization, with it's own core team led by @balazsorban44.
