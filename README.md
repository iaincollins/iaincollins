# ‚úç Side Projects

_Most of my public work on GitHub is on personal side projects and spans different types of software._

## üéÆ [WebGL First Person World Demo](https://demo-scene.vercel.app)

<p align="center">
 <a href="https://demo-scene.vercel.app"><img src="https://github.com/iaincollins/iaincollins/assets/595695/8f51e560-3648-47fb-acd1-9b9888fcf234" width="600"></a>
</p>

A simple first person perspective environment demo for the web, created using low-code using React. Features real time lighting, terrain - trees, rocks and clouds - that are procedurally generated on load and a physics simulation of 100+ objects in the scene. Built with Next.js and React Three Fibre (a wrapper for Three.js, which is in turn an abstraction for WebGL).

## üíΩ [Ardent Industry](https://ardent-industry.com)

<p align="center">
 <a href="https://demo-scene.vercel.app"><img src="https://github.com/iaincollins/iaincollins/assets/595695/92408024-b594-4bb7-9de6-15525885f084" width="600"></a>
</p>

A live-updating database of over 100,000,000 locations, tracking millions of commodity prices across galactic trade markets in the year 3038, using data from players of the game Elite Dangerous (collected from game clients using an API provided by the games developers). It's a low-fi tech solution built entirely in JavaScript and SQLite with a similarly low-fi asthetic.

## üõ∞ [ICARUS Terminal](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus)

<p align="center">
 <a href="https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595695/192074952-3bfa22b1-2dd1-45f6-893e-0f56ae5b87c7.png" width="600"></a>
</p>

ICARUS Terminal is a companion app / second screen for the game Elite: Dangerous, the latest follow up to the 1984 classic space game Elite. Designed for both desktop/laptop computers and for tablets/phones, the app hooks into the game to provide context-sensitive real time information (event driven and socket based) by combining the game API with third party APIs. Built with Next.js, React, Node.js, Go and C++.

## üîë [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

<p align="center">
 <a href="https://next-auth.js.org"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595695/151672056-ba14691b-b260-4010-8b2a-d7429c339319.png" width="600"></a>
</p>

One of the top 1000 open source projects on GitHub (according to GitHub), it's in open source, community supported project based around interoperability with open standards. NextAuth.js has grown to support dozens of auth providers and a wide range of SQL and no-SQL databases. Originally developed for React - and specifically Next.js, hence the name - it has been ported to other popular frameworks, including Vue.js and Svelte and can be used with non-JavaScript frameworks, such as Drupal.

Although I created NextAuth.js, I've since moved on to other projects and am no longer actively involved. To ensure it remains open source, collaborative and independent it has been spun off into a dedicated organization, with it's own core team.

## üé¨ Mercury

<p align="center">

</p>

I developed Mercury with funding from Google DNI. Mercury is a web based video and transcript editor and translation workflow tool that lets you drop-and-drag a video in one language in and then watch it back in other languages, with an editable, timestamped transcript in each language, that can also be exported as subtitles or text.

Designed for news and media organisations, Mercury allows teams to upload, edit, transcode, transcribe and translate audio and video files (in a wide range of formats, including large, unprocessed files) from anywhere in the world on any web enabled device (including a smartphone) and share them in a secure and searchable way.

## üõ† [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://github.com/glitchdigital/structured-data-testing-tool)

<p align="center">
 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595695/136657786-ec1f4db5-433b-41d0-b276-50469e3e9cb0.png" width="600">
</p>

Designed to fill a gap in tooling in Google Lighthouse and Google's own Structured Data Testing Tool, by providing an extendible command line tool and API that includes out of the box support for checking both Schema.org entities and social media markup.

While useful for any website but especially useful for news and media organizations as ensuring markup quality can have a significant impact on traffic coming from Google News and Google Discover, as well as organic traffic from search engines.

## üõ† [Table to JSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabletojson)

A library useful for data scraping, originally created to support work on civic tech and data journalism. [Table to JSON is used by dozens of other packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/tabletojson), in other higher level scraper libraries and in projects to track a wide range of things from COVID-19 data to TV shows, news and weather to class times for students. Table to JSON is now maintained by [@maugenst](https://github.com/maugenst).
