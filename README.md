I'm an engineering lead with 25 years experience developing cross platform software for the web, desktop, server, mobile and networks (including core networks) with contributions to open source spanning over two decades.

Most of my public work on GitHub is on personal side projects. [I sometimes write about stuff on Medium](https://iaincollins.medium.com/).

The app hooks into the game to provide context-sensitive real time information (event driven and socket based) by combining the game API with third party APIs and agumenting them with additional contextual data to inform, entertain and help players.

ICARUS Terminal is built with React, Node.js, Go, C++ and native OS APIs to create a lightweight, highly portable cross platform application with a secure software update mechanism that leverages the the GitHub releases API and a self contained installer that comes in at around 20MB.
