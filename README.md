# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About me

I'm a [software engineering manager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iaincollins) at [Unity](https://unity.com/), with 30 years of experience in software development and systems engineering.

I'm based in Edinburgh, Scotland and my day job is working with a fantastic team on Game Backend systems, specifically focusing on authentication, storage, and socio-competitive services and SDKs. These systems support games with millions of players across all major platforms, including mobile, console, and desktop.

You can find me on Mastodon as <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@iaincollins">@iaincollins</a>, and I occasionally post on [Medium](https://iaincollins.medium.com/).

# ‚úçÔ∏è Side projects

For 25 years, I've been creating, maintaining, and contributing to open-source software, ranging from small libraries to popular frameworks, desktop and server applications, and civic tech projects. These days, most of my projects are side projects I make for fun.

## üéÆ [Procedurally generated scenes using WebGL](https://explore.iaincollins.com)

<p align="center">
 <a href="https://explore.iaincollins.com"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef59f45d-9c56-41cb-b15e-2b90031e6c08" width="600"></a>
</p>

This sample features three distinct environments explorable in a first-person view, generated at runtime using procedural generation. Built with Next.js, React, and React Three Fibre (a wrapper for Three.js, which abstracts WebGL), this unconventional stack serves as a simple demo with player movement and physics interaction. It was an exercise to explore the possibilities of these components and helped me better understand the practical issues relating to implementing a 3D environment using React Three Fibre and Three.js.

## üìà [Ardent Industry](https://ardent-industry.com)

</p>

Ardent Insight is a live-updating database encompassing over 150 million star systems and millions of commodity buy/sell orders in a galactic trade database. It handles a stream driving millions of updates daily. The data originates from players of the game Elite Dangerous, collected from game clients and submitted to the Elite Dangerous Data Network (EDDN) via a process approved by the game's developer, Frontier Developments. Both the frontend and backend are built in JavaScript, with SQLite as the database, and include a public REST API.

Beyond being a functional tool for players and developers (who utilize the API in their own third-party apps), it demonstrates how developers can build scalable and reliable backend infrastructure, with support for large scale multiplayer games using open-source software running at very low cost.

## üõ∞ [ICARUS Terminal](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus)

</p>

ICARUS Terminal is a companion app/second screen for Elite: Dangerous, the latest iteration of the 1984 classic space game, Elite. Designed for desktop/laptop computers and tablets/phones, the app integrates with the game to provide context-sensitive, real-time information. This information is event-driven and socket-based, combining data from the game's API with third-party APIs built by fans. It is built with Next.js, React, Node.js, Go, and C++.

## üîë [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

<p align="center">
 <a href="https://next-auth.js.org"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595695/151672056-ba14691b-b260-4010-8b2a-d7429c339319.png" width="600"></a>
</p>

I created NextAuth.js because there wasn't anything like it already and I wanted adding authentication to new projects to be easier. It now has millions of downloads a month and become one of top 1,000 open I created NextAuth.js to simplify adding authentication to new projects, as there wasn't a similar solution available. It now has millions of monthly downloads and has become one of the top 1,000 open-source projects on GitHub and in thousands of projects, and used by millions of end users. 

NextAuth.js is an open-source, community-supported project built around interoperability with open standards. It has expanded to support dozens of authentication providers and a wide range of SQL and NoSQL databases. Initially developed for React, and specifically Next.js (hence the name), it has been ported to other popular JS frameworks like Vue.js and Svelte, can be used with other non-JS systems, like Drupal.

I created the project in 2018 and led it for about 5 years. To ensure its continued open-source, collaborative, and independent nature, I spun the it off into a dedicated organization with its own core team and I am longer actively involved, as I couldn't provide the level of support needed while also meeting my full time responsibilities.

## üé¨ Mercury

<p align="center">

</p>

Mercury is a web based video and transcript editor and translation workflow tool that lets you drop-and-drag a video in one language in and then listen to it back in other languages, with an editable, timestamped transcript in each language, that can be used to edit the spoken audio and can be exported as subtitles or a text document.

Designed for news and media organisations, Mercury allows teams to upload, edit, transcode, transcribe and translate audio and video files in a wide range of formats, including large, unprocessed files - from anywhere in the world on any web enabled device, including a smartphone, and share them in a secure and searchable way.

I got a grant to build Mercury from Google, through Google DNI. 

## üõ† [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://github.com/glitchdigital/structured-data-testing-tool)

<p align="center">

</p>

This tool was designed to address a gap in existing tools like Google Lighthouse and Google's own Structured Data Testing Tool. It provides an extensible command-line tool and API with out-of-the-box support for checking both Schema.org entities and social media markup. While beneficial for any website, it is particularly useful for news and media organizations, as ensuring markup quality can significantly impact traffic from Google News and Google Discover, as well as organic search engine traffic.

## üõ† [Table to JSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabletojson)

A library useful for data scraping, originally created to support work on civic tech and data journalism. [Table to JSON is used by dozens of other packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/tabletojson), in other higher level scraper libraries and in projects to track a wide range of things from COVID-19 data to TV shows, news and weather to class times for students. Table to JSON is now maintained by [@maugenst](https://github.com/maugenst).
