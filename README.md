# üßî About me

_I'm an engineering lead with 20-30 years experience developing cross platform software for the web, desktop, server, mobile and routers with open source projects going back over two decades. I've worked in startups, large enterprises, on non-profit/civic-tech and started two companies (and way too many side projects)._

I live in the UK and I work at [Unity](https://unity.com/) on game backend in [Unity Gaming Services](https://unity.com/solutions/gaming-services).

You can find me on mastodon.social as <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@iaincollins">@iaincollins</a>.

Sometimes I [write about stuff on Medium](https://iaincollins.medium.com/).
 
# ‚úç Side Projects

Most of my work on GitHub is on personal side projects and spans different types of software.

Not everything is public but you can find some recent side projects I've been working on below.

## üõ∞ [ICARUS Terminal](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus)

_üïπÔ∏è Immersive 3rd party interface for the game Elite: Dangerous._

<a href="https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595695/192074952-3bfa22b1-2dd1-45f6-893e-0f56ae5b87c7.png" width="300" align="left"></a>

ICARUS Terminal is a companion app / second screen for the game Elite: Dangerous, the modern online, multiplayer universe successor to the 1984 classic space game Elite. Designed for both desktop/laptop computers and for tablets/phones.

The app hooks into the game to provide context-sensitive real time information (event driven and socket based) by combining the game API with third party APIs and augmenting them with additional contextual data to inform, entertain and help players.

It is built with React, Node.js, Go, C++ and native OS APIs and uses GitHub releases to push updates. It is distributed as a self-contained installer that comes in at around 20MB.

## üîë [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

_‚≠êÔ∏è One of the top 1000 open source projects on GitHub._

<a href="https://next-auth.js.org"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595695/151672056-ba14691b-b260-4010-8b2a-d7429c339319.png" width="270" align="left"></a>

As an open source, community supported project based around interoperability with open standards, NextAuth.js has grown to support dozens of auth providers and a wide range of SQL and no-SQL databases.

Originally developed for React, it has also been ported to other popular frameworks, including Vue.js and Svelte - and can be used with non-JavaScript frameworks, such as Drupal.

To ensure it remains open source, collaborative and independent it has been spun off into a dedicated organization, with it's own core team.

## üé¨ Mercury

_üìº Web based video management, transcription and translation software. Funded by Google._

Mercury is a web based video and transcript editor and translation workflow tool that lets you drop-and-drag a video in one language in and then watch it back in other languages, with an editable, timestamped transcript in each language, that can also be exported as subtitles or text.

Designed for news and media organisations, Mercury allows teams to to upload, edit, transcode, transcribe and translate audio and video files (in a wide range of formats, including large, unprocessed files) from anywhere in the world on any web enabled device (including a smartphone) and share them in a secure and searchable way.

## üõ† [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://github.com/glitchdigital/structured-data-testing-tool)

_Library and command line utility to help inspect and test Structured Data._

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595695/136657786-ec1f4db5-433b-41d0-b276-50469e3e9cb0.png" width="150" align="left">

Designed to fill a gap in tooling in Google Lighthouse and Google's own Structured Data Testing Tool, by providing an extendible command line tool and API that includes out of the box support for checking both Schema.org entities and social media markup.

This tool is useful for any website but especially useful for news and media organizations as ensuring markup quality can have a significant impact on traffic coming from Google News and Google Discover as well as organic traffic.

## üõ† [Table to JSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tabletojson)

_Library and command line tool to extract data from webpages._

A library useful for data scraping, originally created to support work on civic tech and data journalism.

[Table to JSON is used by dozens of other packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/tabletojson), in other higher level scraper libraries and in projects to track a wide range of things from COVID-19 data to TV shows, news and weather to class times for students. Table to JSON is now maintained by [@maugenst](https://github.com/maugenst).
