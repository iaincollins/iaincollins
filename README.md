# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

_I love designing and building things and helping organizations create and grow amazing engineering teams._

I'm a Software Developer, Systems Engineer and Engineering Manager with 25 years of commercial experience across the full product life cycle in startups, SMEs and enterprise organizations, delivering best-in-class, cross platform solutions for the web, desktop, server, mobile and network devices with contributions to open source spanning over 20 years.

I've worked in startups (and founded companies) but have spent most of my career working at internet and media companies, designing and building everything from websites and services to infrastructure (core networks, device firmware, custom kernels and extensions and physical infrastructure; servers, switching and storage) to desktop applications for macOS, Windows and Linux and for mobile devices, using dozens of programming languages, operating systems and hardware platforms.

I enjoy supporting and growing engineers and working collaboratively in cross functional teams to design, build and support products and services. I'm able to zoom in to provide practical, hands-on support with software development and system design if needed - and to step back and provide support and strategic advice for engineering and product teams and help them optimise for delivery.

# üíº Recent Work

Most of my recent work has been leading teams and projects for news and media organizations and with government projects and NGOs, including for BBC News Labs, The Economist and Reach (the UK's largest commercial news publisher) leading teams working on in-house and competitor analytics and machine learning powered recommendations.

I still design and build things, but I'm usually contributing even more when I'm able to support engineering teams, product owners, delivery managers and stakeholders/customers to deliver great products and services.

# üõ† Projects

Some of the side projects I've built recently.

## üîë  [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

_Leading authentication solution designed for modern web stacks, including Next.js and Serverless._

As an open source, community supported project based around interoperability with open standards, NextAuth.js has grown to support dozens of auth providers and a wide range of SQL and no-SQL databases.

Originally developed for React, it has also been ported to other popular frameworks, including Vue.js and Svelte - and can be used with non-JavaScript frameworks, such as Drupal.

To ensure it remains open source, collaborative and independent it has been spun off into a dedicated organization, supported by a team of talented and hard working contributors.

## üé¨  Mercury

_Video management, transcription and translation tool. Sponsored by the Google DNI Prototype fund._

Designed for news and media organisations, Mercury allows teams to to upload, edit, transcode, transcribe and translate audio and video files (in a wide range of formats, including large, unprocessed files) from anywhere in the world on any web enabled device (including a smartphone) and share them in a secure and searchable way with colleagues.

On the technical side, it uses an open source technology stack; including ESCMAScript, React and Web Sockets and uses both Serverless and Container based services. It is horizontally scaling and can be run on Amazon Web Services (AWS S3), Goggle Cloud Platform (Google Drive / Cloud Storage) and on self-hosted servers (local storage, NAS).

It supports integration with multiple specialist transcription, translation and synthetic voice services from IBM, Google and Microsoft and other specalist vendors.

## üß∞  [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://github.com/glitchdigital/structured-data-testing-tool)

_Library and command line tool to help inspect and test Structured Data._

Designed to fill a gap in tooling in Google Lighthouse and Google's own Stuctured Data Testing Tool, by providing an extendible command line tool that includes out of the box support for checking both Schema.org entities and social media markup.

This tool is useful for any website but especially useful for news and media organizations as ensuring markup quality can have a significant impact on taffic coming from Google News and Google Discover as well as organic traffic.

## üëæ  EDV _(working title)_

Cross platform video game companion app for Windows, Mac, Andriod and iOS devices, that hooks into Elite Dangerous to provide context-sensitive real time information (event driven and socket based) by combining the Elite Dangerous API with third party APIs and agumenting them with additional contextual data to inform, entertain and guide players.

It's still a work in progress. I haven't released a binary or the source yet, but have released a few screenshots and a couple of videos.
