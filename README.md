ICARUS Terminal is a companion app / second screen for the game Elite Dangerous, the modern online, multiplayer universe sucessor to the 1984 classic space game Elite. It is designed for both desktop/laptop computers and for tablets/phones.

The app hooks into Elite Dangerous to provide context-sensitive real time information (event driven and socket based) by combining the games API with third party APIs and agumenting them with additional contextual data to inform, entertain and help players.

ICARUS Terminal was initially developed a proof of concept in Electron, but has been re-implemented using Go, Node.js and native OS APIs to create a lightweight, highly portable cross platform application with a secure software update mechanism using the GitHub releases API and a self contained installer that comes in at around 20MB.

## üîë [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

_Leading authentication solution designed for modern web stacks, including Next.js and Serverless._

As an open source, community supported project based around interoperability with open standards, NextAuth.js has grown to support dozens of auth providers and a wide range of SQL and no-SQL databases.

Originally developed for React, it has also been ported to other popular frameworks, including Vue.js and Svelte - and can be used with non-JavaScript frameworks, such as Drupal.

To ensure it remains open source, collaborative and independent it has been spun off into a dedicated organization, supported by a team of talented and hard working contributors.
