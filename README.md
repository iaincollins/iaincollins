# About

I'm a Software Developer, Systems Engineer and Engineering Manager with 25 years of commercial experience across the full product life cycle in startups, SMEs and enterprise organizations, delivering best-in-class, cross platform solutions for the web, desktop, server, mobile and network devices with contributions to open source spanning over 20 years.

I've spent most of my career working for large internet and media companies, designing and building everything from websites and services, to infrastructure (core network devices and device firmware and physical infrastructure) to desktop applications for Mac, Windows and Linux and for mobile devices, using dozens of programming languages, operating systems and hardware platforms.

I enjoy supporting and growing engineers and working collaboratively in cross functional teams to design, build and support products and services. I'm able to zoom in to provide practical, hands-on support with software development and system design - and to step back and provide support and strategic advice for engineering and product teams and help them optimise for delivery.

I love designing and building things and helping organizations create and grow amazing engineering teams.

### ðŸ”‘  [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

Designed and built the leading authentication solution designed for modern web stacks, including Next.js and Serverless. 

As an open source, community supported project based around interoperability with open standards, NextAuth.js has grown to support dozens of services and a wide range of SQL and no-SQL databases.

Originally developed for React, it has also been ported to other popular frameworks, including Vue.js and Svelte - and can be used with non-JavaScript frameworks, such as Durpal.

To ensure it remains open source, collaborative and independent it has been spun off into a dedicated organization, supported by a team of talented and hard working contributors.

### ðŸ§°  [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://github.com/glitchdigital/structured-data-testing-tool)

A library and command line tool to help inspect and test Structured Data.

Designed to fill a gap in tooling in Google Lighthouse and Google's own Stuctured Data Testing Tool, by providing an extendible command line tool that includes out of the box support for checking both Schema.org entities and social media markup.

This tool is useful for any website but especially useful for news and media organizations as ensuring markup quality can have a significant impact on news and discover traffic, as well as organic traffic.

### ðŸŽ¬  Mercury

Mercury is a video management, video transcription and translation tool, sponsored by the Google DNI Prototype fund. It allows users to upload, search edit, transcode, transcribe and translate audio and video files (in a wide range of formats, including large, unprocessed files) from anywhere in the world on any web enabled device (including a smartphone) and share them securely with colleagues.

On the technical side, it built with a fully modern open source technology stack (with React, Socket based API and uses both Serverless and Container based services) and is able to run on Amazon Web Services (and AWS S3), Goggle Cloud Platform (and Google Drive) and on self-hosted servers (with local drivers or Network Attached Storage) and supports integration with multiple specialist transcription, translation and synthetic voice services from IBM, Google and Microsoft.
