I'm an engineering lead with over 25 years of experience developing software for the web, desktop, server, mobile and network devices (including core networks) with contributions to open source spanning over two decades. These days, most of the code I write is for fun.

# ‚úç Side Projects

*Some of my more recent side projects.*

## üëæ [ICARUS Terminal](https://github.com/iaincollins/icarus)

ICARUS Terminal is a companion app for the game Elite Dangerous, the modern online, multiplayer universe sucessor to the 1984 classic space game Elite. The name ICARUS was suggested by a player and chosen by the community.

The app hooks into Elite Dangerous to provide context-sensitive real time information (event driven and socket based) by combining the games API with third party APIs and agumenting them with additional contextual data to inform, entertain and help players.

This was initially developed a proof of concept in Electron, but have since refactored it using Go, Node.js and native OS APIs to create a lightweight but highly portable cross platform application with a self contained installer that comes in at around 20MB.

## üîë [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

_Leading authentication solution designed for modern web stacks, including Next.js and Serverless._

As an open source, community supported project based around interoperability with open standards, NextAuth.js has grown to support dozens of auth providers and a wide range of SQL and no-SQL databases.

Originally developed for React, it has also been ported to other popular frameworks, including Vue.js and Svelte - and can be used with non-JavaScript frameworks, such as Drupal.

To ensure it remains open source, collaborative and independent it has been spun off into a dedicated organization, supported by a team of talented and hard working contributors.

On the technical side, it uses an open source technology stack; including ESCMAScript, React and Web Sockets and uses both Serverless and Container based services. It is horizontally scaling and can be run on Amazon Web Services (AWS S3), Goggle Cloud Platform (Google Drive / Cloud Storage) and on self-hosted servers (local storage, NAS).

It supports integration with multiple specialist transcription, translation and synthetic voice services from IBM, Google and Microsoft and other specalist vendors.
