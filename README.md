# About

I love designing and building things and helping organizations create and grow amazing engineering teams.

I'm a Software Developer, Systems Engineer and Engineering Manager with 25 years of commercial experience across the full product life cycle in startups, SMEs and enterprise organizations, delivering best-in-class, cross platform solutions for the web, desktop, server, mobile and network devices with contributions to open source spanning over 20 years.

I've spent most of my career working at internet and media companies, designing and building everything from websites and services, to infrastructure (core network devices and device firmware, custom kernels and extensions and physical infrastructure) to desktop applications for Mac, Windows and Linux and for mobile devices, using dozens of programming languages, operating systems and hardware platforms.

I enjoy supporting and growing engineers and working collaboratively in cross functional teams to design, build and support products and services. I'm able to zoom in to provide practical, hands-on support with software development and system design - and to step back and provide support and strategic advice for engineering and product teams and help them optimise for delivery.

# ðŸ›  Side Projects

Most of my recent work is with leading teams and/or projects with news and media organizations, from BBC News Labs, to technical lead on The Economist redesign work and design system and my current role as a lead in the Data Team at Reach (the UK's largest commercial News Publisher), on in house and competitor analytics tools and machine learning powered action recommendation system.

Some of the side projects I've been working on recently.

## ðŸ”‘  [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

_Leading authentication solution designed for modern web stacks, including Next.js and Serverless._

As an open source, community supported project based around interoperability with open standards, NextAuth.js has grown to support dozens of services and a wide range of SQL and no-SQL databases.

Originally developed for React, it has also been ported to other popular frameworks, including Vue.js and Svelte - and can be used with non-JavaScript frameworks, such as Drupal.

To ensure it remains open source, collaborative and independent it has been spun off into a dedicated organization, supported by a team of talented and hard working contributors.

## ðŸŽ¬  Mercury

_Video management, transcription and translation tool. Sponsored by the Google DNI Prototype fund._

Designed for news and media organisations, Mercury allows teams to to upload, edit, transcode, transcribe and translate audio and video files (in a wide range of formats, including large, unprocessed files) from anywhere in the world on any web enabled device (including a smartphone) and share them in a secure and searchable way with colleagues.

On the technical side, it built with a fully modern open source technology stack (with React, Socket based API and uses both Serverless and Container based services) and is able to run on Amazon Web Services (and AWS S3), Goggle Cloud Platform (and Google Drive) and on self-hosted servers (with local drivers or Network Attached Storage).

It supports integration with multiple specialist transcription, translation and synthetic voice services from IBM, Google and Microsoft and other specalist vendors.

## ðŸ§°  [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://github.com/glitchdigital/structured-data-testing-tool)

_Library and command line tool to help inspect and test Structured Data._

Designed to fill a gap in tooling in Google Lighthouse and Google's own Stuctured Data Testing Tool, by providing an extendible command line tool that includes out of the box support for checking both Schema.org entities and social media markup.

This tool is useful for any website but especially useful for news and media organizations as ensuring markup quality can have a significant impact on taffic coming from Google News and Google Discover as well as organic traffic.

## ðŸ‘¾  EDV (unreleased; working title)

A cross platform video game companion app for Windows, Mac, Andriod and iOS devices, that hooks into Elite Dangerous to provide context-sensitive real time information( event driven and socket based) by combining in-game API and third party APIs.

I haven't released this yet, but here are some teaser shots:
